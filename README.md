# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website 🌟

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase an individual's skills, experience, and projects. It provides a clean and professional online presence, allowing potential clients or employers to easily learn about the individual and their work. The website features an "About Me" section, a resume display, a portfolio of projects, a blog (potentially linked externally), and a contact form. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and accessible. It solves the problem of creating a professional online presence without needing extensive coding knowledge, by providing a well-structured and easily customizable template.

🚀 **Key Features**

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).
*   **Interactive Sidebar:** A collapsible sidebar provides easy navigation and contact information.
*   **Portfolio Filtering:** Allows users to filter portfolio items by category.
*   **Contact Form Validation:** Ensures that the contact form is filled out correctly before submission.

*   **Clean and Modern Design:** A visually appealing design that is both professional and user-friendly.
*   **Testimonial Section:** Showcases client testimonials to build trust and credibility.

📦 **Getting Started / Setup Instructions**

**Prerequisites**

*   A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
*   A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom)

**Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.

**Running Locally**

1.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.**
2.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.** The website should now be running locally.
3.  **To modify the content, edit the `index.txt` file.**  You will need a templating engine or custom script (not provided) to parse this file and update the HTML dynamically.  Without that, you can directly edit the `index.html` file.
4.  **To modify the styling, edit the `assets/css/style.css` file.**
5.  **To modify the interactivity, edit the `assets/js/script.js` file.**

💻 **Usage**

1.  **Customizing Content:** Modify the `index.txt` file to update the content of the website, such as your name, title, about me section, services, and testimonials.
2.  **Customizing Styling:** Modify the `assets/css/style.css` file to change the appearance of the website, such as colors, fonts, and layout.
3.  **Adding Portfolio Items:** Add or modify the portfolio items in the `index.html` file or through the `script.js` file if you implement dynamic loading.
4.  **Setting up the Contact Form:** Ensure that the contact form in `index.html` is properly configured to send emails to your desired address.  This might require server-side scripting (not included).
